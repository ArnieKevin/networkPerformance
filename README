Project retiring/moved
======================

Now that I've pushed out boomerang (http://github.com/yahoo/boomerang/), I will no longer
update this project separately.  The bandwidth measurement code has been rolled into
boomerang, and I'll continue development there.  You should use boomerang instead.

Thanks for watching.

Philip


======================


1. Unpack the .zip file into a web accessible directory
2. Read the comments in bw-test.js or look at the tests in tests/*.html for information
   on how to use this code.  Also look at index.html and runtest.js
3. Update the base_url variable in bw-test.js to the URL that you unzipped the files into
4. You can get rid of the tests/ directory once you're done reading it
